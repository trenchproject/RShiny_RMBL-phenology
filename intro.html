<h4>Digital RMBL:  Effects of rapid climate change on phenology at high altitudes</h4>

Virtually all species use predictable yearly changes in their local climate to determine when to initiate life-cycle events like breeding, flowering, and migration. Environmental factors such as temperature, day length, and precipitation can directly control the timing of these biological events, or act as cues that set an organism’s “biological clock” (Forrest and Miller-Rushing 2010). Over the past two decades, a growing body of evidence suggests that climate change is affecting this seasonal timing, or <b>phenology</b>, of plants and animals in a wide range of ecosystems, including temperate forests (Both et al. 2009), freshwater lakes (Seebens et al. 2009), and the open ocean (Koeller et al. 2009). While these shifts in an organism’s life-history timing may keep it wellsynchronized with local environmental changes, its interactions with other species may be disrupted.  This <b>tropic mismatch</b>, or decoupling of interacting species, can result if the species do not show the same phenological shifts in response to a changing environment. For example, as the initiation plant growth has advanced in response to warming spring temperatures, peak food availability no longer corresponds to the timing of caribou reproduction, resulting in fewer births and more deaths among caribou calves in Greenland (Post and Forchhammer 2008). This trophic mismatch results from species using different environmental signals to regulate their phenology: the caribou are cued by increasing day length to migrate to areas where newly-emergent food should be plentiful, but plants initiate growth in response to temperature, not day-length.

In the following case study, you will explore a long-term data set of climatic variables and phenology that have been collected at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) in Gothic, Colorado for several decades. Since the mid-1970s, long-term resident and RMBL accountant, billy barr (he does not capitalize his name), has been recording weather conditions and the date of first sightings of many animal and plant species following snow melt. These data provide a unique opportunity to look for trends in phenology as they relate to climatic conditions.

<h4>How to use the app</h4>
<b>Part 1A</b>
<br>
In the "vs Year" tab, you can select a snow condition and the first spring sighting of organisms to see how they changed between 1974 and 1999. The unit "JD" stands for Julian Date, which simply indicates the day of year, where Day 1 = January 1, Day 32 = February 1, and so on. 
<br>
Trend line analysis provides statistics on the slope of the line, p-value and R<sup>2</sup> values.
<br>
Additionally, selecting two points on the plot allows you to calculate the rate of change between specific years.
<br>
<br>
<b>Part 1B</b>
<br>
The period can be changed to 2000-2010 or 1974-2010 to see if the trend holds on different time frames. 
In the "vs snow conditions" tab, you can plot phenology over snow conditions and obtain statistics on the regression line.
<br>
<br>
<b>Part 3</b>
<br>
In the "vs other weather data", you can plot phenology over other weather variables such as temperature and melt water equivalent and obtain statistics on the trend line.
