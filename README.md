https://huckley.shinyapps.io/RShiny_RMBL-phenology/
 
This shiny app is a substitution for a student activity on climate change and phenology developed by Wu. The original pdf file is [here](https://tiee.esa.org/vol/v13/issues/data_sets/wu/pdf/wu.pdf).
The data are collected in Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado for over 30 years.

This app can be used to visualize the relationships between climatic variables and phenology and obtain relevant statistics. These will help think about the questions presented in the pdf.
